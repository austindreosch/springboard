          These rankings assign each player a value as an overall dynasty asset
          - determined at an intersection of current impact, projected future
          impact, and trade value. My player evaluation assumes that you are in
          a league that will last atleast longer than 3 years into the future,
          and incorporates standard 9-category format factors like stat scarcity
          and punt value.

            For all of Luka's all-time great qualities, he honestly has still
            stagnated as it comes to fantasy. He remains one of the most
            negative FG/FT% impact players in the league (considering his
            volume) to go with very mediocre defensive stats. There really is a
            case to be made that Lamelo is a better pick here with what I
            consider to be a slightly more desirable stat-profile but I have to
            admit that there is something to how transcendent Luka has become
            from a real-NBA perspective. It really makes you think he is one of
            these all-time great players who will be able to improve these
            things in coming seasons as he works into his prime.

As fantasy stats goes, he is basically doing everything Luka is but with elite FT% and STL instead of a few extra points - but I think more of that will come. A player being able to put up top-15 value in his 2nd season is crazy, and it seems we're likely about to witness a machine-like 24/8/8/2 for the next 10+ years and one of the best fantasy players ever. I'd be completely happy taking him #1 if you'd prefer his stat-profile.</td>

            A disappointing Hawks seasons doesn't give me any disillusions about
            Trae's fantasy dominance. He's clearly the next coming of Damian
            Lillard/James Harden but got himself to that level at a much earlier
            age. Elite assists, points, and FT% impact will always be one of the
            most highly coveted stat combinations and he's the best young player
            by far in that regard.

            Yet another top-15 season for Tatum and he's only 24 years old. He

            and Boston has repeatedly refused to pull the trigger on big free
            agent deals, so nothing really stands in the way of Tatum being

            cracked the top-10 to shut up all the constant gossip about his poor
            shooting. He is who he is, and now it's just about how long he can
            do it. Your guess is as good as mine on that, but he needs to be
            picked up here regardless because he is the most dominant player in
            the league in punt strategies.

            Coming up on his age 27 season, the youth value is slowly slipping
            and Edwards is dragging on his ceiling. Still, getting huge 3PM and
            FT% impact from a big man is just too incredible to pass up further
            than this. He brings absurd value across 9-cats and puts up top-5
            seasons like it's nothing. Should be able to easily have a longer
            career than most centers with his elite shooting touch.

            He didn't make quite the huge splash we may have hoped for at his

            real deal and he's going to be good. His fantasy profile is
            everything we covet in a young stud player, and I expect year 2 to
            be a huge explosion for him, so get your hands on him if you still

            with 2+ stls cannot be left off the first round of a dynasty draft
            under any circumstances. If you can get him for a bargain before

            Efficiency and assists have improved this year and he's already one
            of the most dominant scorers in the league. The sky is the limit in
            my eyes.
