            For all of Luka's all-time great qualities, he honestly has still
            stagnated as it comes to fantasy. He remains one of the most
            negative FG/FT% impact players in the league (considering his
            volume) to go with very mediocre defensive stats. There really is a
            case to be made that Lamelo is a better pick here with what I
            consider to be a slightly more desirable stat-profile but I have to
            admit that there is something to how transcendent Luka has become
            from a real-NBA perspective. It really makes you think he is one of
            these all-time great players who will be able to improve these
            things in coming seasons as he works into his prime.

            One of the most impressive showings as a sophomore player I've ever
            seen. As fantasy stats goes, he is basically doing everything Luka
            is but with elite FT% and STL instead of a few extra points - but I
            think more of that will come. A player being able to put up top-15
            value in his 2nd season is crazy, and it seems we're likely about to
            witness a machine-like 24/8/8/2 for the next 10+ years and one of
            the best fantasy players ever. I'd be completely happy taking him #1
            if you'd prefer his stat-profile.

            He was the best fantasy player last year by a mile, and is the
            single most winning player in the league with his absolutely insane
            out-of-position value in AST/FT/STL. Only misses out on the #1 spot
            here because of age, but he has the potential to have a much longer
            prime than most elite centers because of his slow cerebral game.

            A disappointing Hawks seasons doesn't give me any disillusions about
            Trae's fantasy dominance. He's clearly the next coming of Damian
            Lillard/James Harden but got himself to that level at a much earlier
            age. Elite assists, points, and FT% impact will always be one of the
            most highly coveted stat combinations and he's the best young player
            by far in that regard.

            picked up here regardless because he is the most dominant player in

            Coming up on his age 27 season, the youth value is slowly slipping
            and Edwards is dragging on his ceiling. Still, getting huge 3PM and
            FT% impact from a big man is just too incredible to pass up further
            than this. He brings absurd value across 9-cats and puts up top-5
            seasons like it's nothing. Should be able to easily have a longer
            career than most centers with his elite shooting touch.
